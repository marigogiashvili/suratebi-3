    <b> Lorem Ipsum </b>  is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown <br>
        <i> printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining <br>
         essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <mark> <u> <i> 1960s </i> </u> </mark>  with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software <br>
          like Aldus PageMaker including versions of </i>   <b> Lorem Ipsum. </b> <br>
          <br>
          <b> There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't <br>
            look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. “All the <br>
             Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet“. It uses a dictionary of over 200 <br>
              Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. <i> The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free <br>
                from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc. </b>  </i>
